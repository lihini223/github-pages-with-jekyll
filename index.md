In early June 2016, This 36-year-old brilliant businesswoman called Dr Ruja Ignatova walked on stage at Wembley Arena in front of thousands of adoring fans. she told the cheering crowd that OneCoin was on course to become the world's biggest cryptocurrency for everyone to make payments everywhere.

Bitcoin was the first and best-known cryptocurrency in the world. And still, it is the biggest cryptocurrency that rises its value from a few cents to thousands of dollars per coin by mid-2016. This performance has given rise to a frenzy of excitement among investors to get involved in this strange new opportunity.
